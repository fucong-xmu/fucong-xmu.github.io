I'm a first-year PhD student from [College of Physical Science and Technology](https://cpst.xmu.edu.cn/), [Xiamen University](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/). My research interests include nonequilibrium thermodynamics, transformation thermodynamics, active matter thermodynamics, and thermomechanical engineering optimization and control. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Yu-han Ma](https://physicsfaculty.bnu.edu.cn/teacher/376/index.html) from [School of Physics and Astronomy](https://physics.bnu.edu.cn/), [Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/index.htm).
